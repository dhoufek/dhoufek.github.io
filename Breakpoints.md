It’s foolish to define breakpoints that attempt to target the resolutions of popular devices and screen sizes. Those resolutions are constantly changing as manufacturers compete to pack more pixels into screens. Screen size matters little on desktop as a user can resize a browser window to a seemingly infinite combination of heights and widths. Instead, this framework’s device-agnostic breakpoints map to values in its [modular scale](https://github.com/unl/wdntemplates/wiki/Modular-Scale).

| Breakpoint       | Notation | Em Value | Pixel Value |
| ---------------- |----------|---------:| -----------:|
| Small            | `sm`     |    42.09 |      673.48 |
| Medium           | `md`     |    56.12 |      897.97 |
| Large            | `lg`     |    74.83 |     1197.3  |
| Extra Large      | `xl`     |    99.78 |     1596.4  |
